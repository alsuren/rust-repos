# TODO: Add palette-rs, image, backtrace-rs, error-chain, clap, byteorder | serde
# Byteorder is if we want to write the format ourselves
# Serde allows for simple serialization.
#
# It basically comes down to: Do we want to abstract away the on-disk format?
# Probably not, so we'll use byteorder.
#
# NOTE for image: Unneccessary in mister once native plugins land, or a binding to the scripting language is made (prob. both)
# In fact, I'm probably not going to add image as a library to mister, but as one to the plugin I make right after to handle
# some importing and exporting.
# IMPORTANT NOTE (due to image): Import/export plugins must POTENTIALLY support more than one format.
# TODO: Add slog outputs
