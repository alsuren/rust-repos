# A software-based compositor (`swrast`) is used when other backends are not
# available for some reason. This is horrendously slow on debug builds and hurts
# developer experience. To mitigate this issue, always enable optimization for
# `tcw3_pal`. This isn't as fast as the release build due to lack of LTO, but
# at least it's usable.
