# The Rust compiler inserts what are called "panic landing pads", which call the
# destructors for stack-allocated objects when a `panic!` is triggered, so that
# allocated memory is still freed when the stack unwinds.
#
# This unfortunately requires a specific gcc library, which we don't have. So
# tell the compiler to not insert landing pads in code, and instead just abort
# the program without calling destructors. Any allocated memory will be freed
# by the OS when the process terminates, so it doesn't really make a difference,
# but the landing pad system is "neater".
