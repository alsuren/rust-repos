[features]

# Select the Super Gameboy bootrom instead of the classic one. It
# doesn't have the scrolling logo and starts up faster. None of the
# SGB-specific features will be handled but that shouldn't cause any
# compatibility issues besides the fact that it will accept to run
# ROMs with invalid headers unlike the original bootrom.
